## GABAergic inhibition

- 5.1 GABAergic inhibition

  - avoid excitation explosion

  - GABA : gamma-aminobutyric acid

  - very specific : target speicfic ompartments like distal dendristes, axon initial segment, soma

  - vescile

    - synthesisis : take glutamate and transform it into GABA by cutting CO2 with enzyme GAD (cytosol or directly on vescile membrane)
    - package : by protein versicular GABA transporter VGAT by using proton and electical gradient to sucks GABA inside, 100mM

  - ligand-gated ion channels : outwards current

    - GABA_A : permeable to anions, chloride conductance, ms timing
    - chloride concentration : strong gradient between outside (120mM) and inside (5mM), reversial potential of -85mV

  - leaky chloride channels : on all cell membrane

  - active process to keep chloride concentration low : at soma, 12 transmembrane protein transport (KCC2) slowly chloride outside (transported together with potassium, 1-to-1 stoichiometry), energy provided by strong potassium gradient, different in dentritic and axonal membrane

  - early development : chloride concentration different, can polarize the cell, high 30mM inside, 120mM outside, because KCC2 expression low

    ![FC8FF8B5-D0FB-4BBD-9F3F-C16ACE8682D9](img/FC8FF8B5-D0FB-4BBD-9F3F-C16ACE8682D9.png)

  - GABA_B metabotropic receptor : via 7-transmembrane, G-protein activate potassium conductance, slow, at some distance from actuall synapse

    - GIRK : G-protein inward rectifying potassium conductance, delay 50ms, last longer 200ms (diffuse, multistep activation), **question**
    - inhibit : calcium influx, both postsynaptically and presynaptically on buttons, play important that reduce neurotransmitter release

  - glycine : GABA less used in brainstem and spinal cord, glycine works the same way as GABA_A

- 5.2 Inhibitory synaptic conductances

  - GABA_A channel : 10-30pS conductance, brief pulse, 1mM concentration, 10-20ms duration of 1ms pulse (solver than AMPA), 5 subunits
  - reverse potential : -75mV
  - to mesure current-clamp : resting potential is to close -75mV, need to depolarize the cell to see, inject 100pA of current 
  - shunting inhibition : even if resting close to chloride reversal potential and no flow of current, there is a conductance which that act as if it reduces membrane resistance (membrane potential changer faster and is small)
  - target structure GABA_A
    - dentrites
    - soma
    - axon initial segment : form editing function, can output an AP or not
    - synapse : only in the spinal cord

- 5.3 Benzodiazepines

  - neuropharmycology : treating brain diseases

  - experimentally use : not useful for therapy

    - AMPA : CNQX, MBQX
    - NMDA : APV, MK-801
    - GAMA-A : picrotoxin, bicuculline, gabazine (antagonists)

  - Benzodiazepines : extensively use therapy, increase affinity of GABA-A receptor for GABA, total charge transfered is larger, highly specific 

  - GABA binding site : alpha-beta

  - Benzodiazepine binding site : between alpha and either gamma2 or gamma3

    ![325679CE-47A0-4A20-ACA8-8F8B02388A9A](img/325679CE-47A0-4A20-ACA8-8F8B02388A9A.png)

  - amino acid sequences of GABA-A receptors : no effect upon a4 or a6 (a1-2-3-5 is fine) if there is not histidine but argine at position 101

    - sedation action : relax/sleep mediated by a1
    - anxiolysis : reduction in anxiety mediated by a2

- 5.4 GABAergic projections

  - neo-cortex : most short axon, a few hundreads of microns
  - other part : long range
  - neurons in reticular nucleus of thalamus : whiskers trigger glutamate in brainstem, propagate again in thalamus and then to the primary somatosensory cortex
    - nucleus reticularis : fast feedback inibition to thalamus
    - prevent AP firing outside a very narrow time window : if enough fired, trigger an inhibitory AP, millisecond precision
  - striatal projection neurons of basal ganglia
    - striatum : full of gabagertic neurons : receive both excitation from cortex and from higher thalamic areas
    - inhibit substantia nigra (SN) : tonicaly active gabargertic neurons, inhibit  brain stem motor area and prevent the animal of moving, also send dopamine to striatum from (SN compacta)
      - dopamine : diffuse in extra cellular space to D1(direct path that inhibit SN, go pathway) to D2 (indirect path that inhibit globus pallidus that propagate to SN, no go pathway) on different neurons with different plasticity (learning signal)
      - Parkinson : caused by dopaminergic neurons degeneration, bradykinesia, deficit in D1
  - purkinje cells of cerebellum (little brain) : useful integrators that coordinate sensory motor actions
    - cerebellum cortex : inhibit deep cerebellum

- 5.5 Neocortical inhibition

  - neocortex : 85% excitatory, 15% inhibitory, local microcircuits 
  - paravalbumin expressing PV : fast-spiking, hundreads of Hz maximum rate, AP half width 300us, 50% chance connectivity with excitatory neurons
    - **what is expressing ?**
    - glutamatergic pyramidal neuro : lower maximum firing rate, an order of magnitude lower
    - Parvalbumin expressing basket cell : sends axon close to soma in basket shape, fast hyperpolarizing IPSP mediated by GADA-A, large majority
    - Parvalbumin expressing chandelier cell : target axon initial segments, edit whether cell able to output AP
  - somatostatin expressing Sst : target specific distal dentritic, mostly in L1, receive pre-synpatic facilitation from nearby pyramidal cells
  - vasoactive intestinal peptide expressing VIP : inhibit other gabaergic neurons, dis-inhibition
  - neurogliaform cells :  small compact cell with extremely dense axonal arborization close to soma, no obvious postsynaptic partner, release in extra cellular space
