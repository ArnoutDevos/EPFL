  - transparent : everything is showed to the team (included in-person progress)
- needs
  - safety
  - security

  - performance
  - manageability
- soft. errors is costly
- need for reliability : mars, rocket, cars
- improve developers productivity
- stimulate programmers creativity
- make cheaper to build good software

## Software engineering
- powerful tools 
- management : large soft. project need coordinations (and budjet control)
  ![](img/305-3.jpg)
  ![](img/305-4.jpg)
- understand the problem
  - read carefully
  - digest and think
  - break down the problem
  - separate thinking from execution
- time management : key to success
  - make a plan with deadlines
  - expect the unexpected : margin of error (nasty bugs)
  - track time-to-deliver, learn from mistakes (analysis)
- team coordination
  - designate a part-time manager : rotate management role among team members
  - tracker system : split problem into individual, assign task to people
  - how to deal with slacker : set per-task deadlines, present concrete evidence
- team effort
  - code reviewed by peers : >= on each piece of code
  - put code in the public eye : public tests and results
  - get involved in others code
- think of code as write-once/read-many
  - focus on code readability
  - adopt a specific coding style for the team
  - self-documenting code repository : informative commit messages, enable checkstyle
  - code in repository should always compile
- use quantitative metrics
  - measurement : #1 rule in engineering
  - examples : code size, test effectiveness/efficiency, debugging effectiveness/efficiency, productivity (LoC)
- what if you screw up
  - avoid foolish optimism
  - add more people : only if clear splitted tasks
  - best choice is reduce scope of project : less functionality, partition into (must-have/nice-to-have/optional)
- work smarter
  - be agile : prototype and throw if not good, fix inefficiencies on the go, don't aim for perfection
  - be smart : factor out things need > 3 usages
  - love what you do : invest time in learning the full power of tools, contribute to open-source projects, news

## Building software
![](img/305-5.jpg)

- defining the problem : what problem should the software solve? (product vision, definition)
  - brief : less than 2 pages
  - no reference to possible solutions
  - from users point of view
- formulating requirements : what should the software do to solve the problem? (functional specification)
  - acts as a contract between user and developer
  - makes users requirements explicit
- good functional specifications
  - all user tasks : description, expected reponse time, success vs failure
  - all system inputs : source, accuracy, value range frquency of arrival
  - all system outputs : destination, accuracy, value range, format
  - all interfaces with the rest of the world : hw, sw, communication interfaces
- good functional specs
  - requirements are verifiable : quantitative vs qualitative assessment
  - competing attriutes can be resolved
  - clear connection to problem definition
- requirement change
  - customer does not know what he wants
  - 25% of requirements change during development : account for 75% of the amout of work
- software architecture
  - data design : data structures, DB tables, interoperability
  - user interface : GUI, CLI, UI replaceable (evolution and testing)
  - resources : memory, disk space, threads, etc.
  - level of fault tolerance
  - detection and handling of errors
  - build vs reuse
  - internationalization
  - design for change extensibility 
    ![](img/305-6.jpg)
- block approach : requirements -> architecture -> detail design -> construction -> testing
  - when requirements are stable
  - design is straighforward and well understood
  - development team need not to experiment
- agile approach : bounce between everything
  - when requirement are blurry
  - complex and challenging design
  - dev. team not familiar with the soft. being built

## Dev. tools
![](img/305-7.jpg)

- preprocessors : macros
- compilers : static analysises, complexity metrics
- linker
- builders
- testing/debugging framework : coverage tools, fault injectors, logging
- profiler : identify bottlenecks, time spent
- IDE
- VCS
- continuous integrations server
- documentation automators
- CASE : computer aided soft. engineering (code generation)

## Version control systems

- checkpoints of a project
- rebuild any version of the project (revert if needed)
- finds bugs introduced
- save and copy the code
- trace evolution and issue
- share code dev.
- branching allow parallel work
- conflict : modification overlap
  - syntactic
  - semantic : change behaviour
    ![](img/305-1.jpg)

## Code layout
- logical structure of program
- make the code understandable
- whitespace : key to understandable text
- indentation : 2-4 spaces optimal
- parentheses to clarify
- class layout
  - header comment
  - class data
  - public methods
  - protected methods
  - private methods
- files : separate files for interface and implementations, one class per file, name of file after the name of the class
- formatting : length of line <= 120 chars. and length of class <= 2'000
- imports : avoid wildcard, avoid platform-specific, group imports by package
- methods parameters : no alignmenent
- simple methods : small and focused (not > 50 LoC, max 7 params)
- braces : always
- vertical alignements can make things more readable
- split complex predicates cleanly
- multi-line statements : make incompleteness obvious
- each line should do one thing
- var names
  - short but clear
  - long names for rarely used variables
  - loop indexes only inside of loop : i, j, k
  - computed-value qualifies at end of vars : total, sum, average, max, min, count
  - common opposites : begin/end, first/last, locked/unlocked, min/max, next/previous, old/new, opened/closed, visible/invisibe, source/target, source/destination, up/down
  - purpose-driven naming (no temp)
  - no flag in the name
  - avoid hybrid coupling (hidden meaning) : prefer things like positiveBytes
- separate namespaces
- use enums liberally
- bools : use done, error, found, success names but positive meaning
- shortening names : remove non-leading vowels, remove articles, remove useless endings, stay consistent, should pass the telephone test
- data declaration : put in comments what cannot go in name
- avoid numerals namings or commonly misspelled words
- improper initilization : fertile source of bugs, should be close to usage, can be set to final
- use const instead or hardcoded value

## Metrics and symptoms
- variable span : LoC between successive references
- variable liveness interval : LoC between first and last reference (can be reordered at compile time)
- variable scope : program space where var is valid
  ![](img/305-8.jpg)
- in general, try to minimize these
- soft. system : group of interconnected components that exhibits an exprected collective behavior observed at the interfaces with its environment
- symptoms of complexity
  - large number of components : libs
  - large number of interconnections
  - many irregularities and exceptions
  - high "Kolmogorov" complexity : minimal lenght of a description of the object

## Modularity and abstraction
- structured programming
  - single-entry/exit control constructs
  - no unpredictable jump
  - can reason about
- OOP
  - encapsulation
  - contain behavior inside of modules
  - isolation
  - configure and maintain separately
- virtualization : server consolidation, on-demand cloud computing, replication
- modules : replaceable units
- top design : break down into major subsystems, define interfaces for them, internal class design left to programmer
- example of abstractions : routines, lambda, objects

## Good interfaces
- guidlines
  - clean and lean : compartmentalized, avoid being too clever, aim for minimality
  - loosely coupled : minize bonds to other classes, avoid implicit connections
  - portable : avoid exposing environement
  - extensible : anticipate change
  - stratified : use layers of abstraction, nested classes
  - reusable : capture the right level of fundamental attributes correspondin to level of abstraction
  - maintainable : self-explanatory design, use hierarchy, design for testability, be paranoid
- hide what is likely to change : protects from legacy code

## Audit methods and defensive programming
- use invariants (always truee)
- pre/post-conditions
- asserts : assumptions, impossible case, documentation (`java -ea` to enable), default switch statement
- audit can check invariant at call
  - testing, debugging during execution
  - beware of concurrency
  - return the number of errors
- garbage in output non garbage
- source of garbage : errors, corruption, unpredictable events
- handling garbage
  - nothing out
  - error message out
  - clean input
- things to check : reference not null, valid range, stream status, file access type
- throw exception if bad input
  - at right level of abstraction
  - informative
  - cost : cost of getting wrong input x probability of it being wrong
    ![](img/305-9.jpg)
- fix invalid data : previously used value, neutral value, closest legal value
- be careful on known truths
- sanity checks for your program
- defensive copying

## Testing
- systematic process of running a program and verifying
- prevent bug respawn
- "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!" Dijkstra
- definitions : bug (fault) -> error -> failure
  - error : a discrepancy between a computed, observed, or measured  value or condition and the true, specified, or theoretically correct  value or condition
  - failure : the inability of a system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements
  - fault : an incorrect step, process, or data definition in a computer  program which causes the program to perform in an unintended or  unanticipated manner
  - bug : a fault in a program which causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner
- goal of testing is to identify faults
- types of tests
  - unit tests : self-contained test of a method, class, module
  - integration tests : do the pieces work together
  - check-in tests (smoke tests) :inexpensive, broad coverage of apps's functionality (run before every check-in)
  - regression tests : thorough tests (high coverage), test of every bug that has been encountered
  - random testing (fuzz testing) : concolic testing
- white box vs black box testing
- cannot prove correctness
- risk management
- bug density : 10-100 bugs / KLoC after coding, 1-5 bugs / KLoC not detected before delivery
- boundary testing : special cases
- equivalence classes : two classes one check
- traditional quality assurance
  - run code in your head
  - heed IDE warnings
  - heed compiler warnings
  - code review
  - unit testing (black + white)
  - integration testing
  - system testing
  - alpha testing
  - beta testing
- metrics : covered if it is executed by at least one test (methods, statements, branches, paths coverage)
- tension between quality vs cost
- unit test : independ of each other
- others testings
  - acceptance testing : performed by user upon receiving product
  - smoke/sanity testing : quick test for serious errors (compile)
  - compatibility testing : work elsewhere
  - fault injection : bad inputs, no network
  - performance testing
  - usability testing : can users accomplish their objectives with the software as designed ?
- test-driven dev. : write test that fails -> make test pass -> refactor -> ..
  - reduce bug density
  - good candidates : UI logic, buisness logic, any java class
  - bad : UI appearance, client/server interaction, legacy code
  - tips : should cover > 90%, TDD at start of project, displice, each problem = test
    ![](img/305-10.jpg)

## Complexity
- the #1 challenge
- paths ~=  2 ^ program size (firefox: 5'000'000 LoC)
- software verification
  - testing
  - human proofs (< 100 LoC) : mathematical view of soft. engineering
  - machine proofs (< 100'000 LoC)
- soft. complexity grows fast
- cannot only rely on testing

## Preventing and finding errors early
- building bridge vs soft. dev. : fundamental difference is that bridge is based on immutable laws
- average vs best programmer
  - initial coding time : 20x ratio
  - debugging time : 20x ratio
  - program execution speed : 10x ratio
  - 80% of contribution from 20% of programmers
- debugging is 50% average dev. cycle
- long-lived errors are expensive : finding errors early reduces time and cost >2x
- cost of downtime : from email app (2000$/h) to trading app (75000$/h)
  ![](img/305-2.jpg)
- test-driven dev. : verification before coding
- behavior-driven dev. : validation before coding
- agile dev. processes : shorten time between coding and error discovery
- discipline and rigor

## Design patterns
- building blocks
- experience = toolbox of reusable solutions
- description : name, problem, solution, consequences
- creational patterns
  - Abstract Factory : assemble something without regard to components details (UI builder call on factory depending on the OS)
  - Builder
  - Factory Method
    - static factory methods : gain control over object creation (from cartesian, from polar)
    - original GOF (gang of four) : delegate to subclasses the decision of what instance of a class to create (polymorphism, non-static)
  - Factory Object 
  - Lazy Initialization
  - Prototype 
  - Singleton : only one object (static get intance, should check for reflexion attacks, can use enum)
- structural patterns
  - Adaptor
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Façade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
- behavioral patterns
  - Chain of Responsibility 
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator 
  - Memento 
  - Observer : one-to-many dependency, subject changes and observers get notified
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
- architectural patterns
  - model-view-controller
  - service-oriented achitecture
- concurrency patterns
  - active object
  - monitor
  - thread pool
- basic patterns
  - encapsulation
    - problem : exposure can lead to invariance
    - solution : hide components
    - consequences : may reduce perfs
  - inheritance
    - problem : similar abstractions
    - solution : inherit default members
    - consequences : runtime dispatching introduces overhead
  - iteration
    - problem : accessing all collection members
    - solution : implementation does traversal
    - consequences : iteration order constrained by implementation
  - exceptions
    - problem : errors occur in one place
    - solution : specialized language struct
    - consequences : handling level unknown
  - iterator
    - problem : iterating over a collection with state
    - solution : encapsulate iteration
    - consequences : can fail rapidly (robust: keep modifications count at creation, check it at each iterator step, throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if changed)
  - strategy
    - problem : different method for different type
    - solution : encapsulate differences into a family
    - consequences : limited interface
  - model-view-controller
    - problem : differentiate gui, data and controls
    - solution : 3 modules with controller controlling model and view
    - consequences : can be fuzzy to split roles
  - adapter
    - problem : class has different interface from what caller expects
    - solution : solution template
    - consequences : overhead but multiple times used
  - decorator
    - problem : augment functionality
    - solution : dynamically add/override behavirs underneath same interface
    - consequences : large number, use factories
  - proxy
    - problem : different object might use same protocol 
    - solution : isolate protocol specification with a surrogate object having the same interface (caching)
    - consequences : can overlap with other patterns
  - composite
    - problem : recursive structures of similar objects used in the same manner
    - solution : compose one or more object behind same interface, blackbox reuse 
    - consequences : need to exhibit same functionality
  - visitor
    - problem : large hierarchy of dispatched overriden function (add new behavior to a group of classes without changing them)
    - solution : centralize same methods in visitor (pattern match)
    - consequences : breaks encapsulation, may need privileges

## Inheritance vs containment
- Liskov Subsitution Principle (LSP) : let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T, then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype if T
  - subtype must preserve supertypes invariants
  - subtype not allowed to strengthen preconditions or weaken postconditions
- inheritance : is a
  - use only when it simplifies design
  - use final when enforcing limitation
  - can break encapsulation (favor private over protected)
  - avoid deep hierarchy (max 3 level and 7+/-2 subclasses, otherwise buggy)
  - avoid linear hierarchy
  - push common things as high up as possible
  - multiple heritance is bad (diamond problem)
- mixins : inheritance of implementations allowed, orthogonal functionality, single purpose, not instantiable in their own
- containement : has a
  - avoid excessive method forwarding
  - contraing class controls the interface
  - use when classes share common data but not behavior
- design by contract
  - caller satisfy precondition : rely on postcondition
  - callee ensure postcondition : rely on precondition
  - by default, pre/post condition are assumed to be true
  - clarify obligations of caller and callee, provide documentation
    ![](img/305-11.jpg)

## UML and comments
![](img/305-12.jpg)
![](img/305-13.jpg)
![](img/305-14.jpg)
![](img/305-15.jpg)
![](img/305-16.jpg)

- natural language is less precise than code
- comment should be checked at reviews (disagree between code and comment is nasty)
- types of comments
  - summary : OK
  - description of code intent : OK
  - repeat, explain the code : BAD
  - code markers (issue) : OK
- comment what, not how
- warn the reader : e.g. workaround
- class comments : header comment contains purpose + design
- interface comments : dependent from implementation
- method header : 1/2 sentence, desribe assumptions, include source (algo)
- end-of-line comments : rarely justified (except for bug or non-obvious case)
- comment while coding
- coding conventions is important : 40-80% of lifetime cost of soft. goes to maintenance
- one convention is better than none or many
- use checkstyle

## Soft. dev. processes
- understand phases of soft. dev.
- dev. phases
  - market research : talks to the users, evaluate feasability, cost
  - requirements gathering and analysis : define product
  - specification, planning, desing : turn requirements into design specification
  - implementation and testing : write (15%) and test with integration (50%)
  - deployment : package code
  - support and maintenance
- prototyping model : frim structured dev. to amorphous dev.
  - waterfall model : linear, well defined, requirement must be known upfront, inflexible
    ![](img/305-19.jpg)
  - iterative model : waterfall with a divide and conquery strategy, benefit of better control, important functionality early, temptation todefer
    - sequence of mini waterfalls
    - break down into mini waterfalls to be pursued in parallel
    - do a waterfall up to design, then do iterative prototyping
  - spiral model : identify risk early, users involved, evoluation possible, maintenance included, complex, can spiral forever, use when medium size, robust implementation more important than functionality
    - objectives (performance, interfaces), alternatives (build, reuse), constraints (cost, schedule)
    - evaluate, identify, resolve risks (lack of experience)
    - develop and verify
    - plan next phase
      ![](img/305-18.jpg)
  - prototyping model (evolutionary model) : encourage user pariticipation, resolves unclearness, innovation, flexibility, difficult to analyse and manage, use for high-pressure, short-lived, customer not very knowledgeable
    ![](img/305-17.jpg)
- agile methods : scrum, adaptive soft. dev., feature driven dev., crystal clear, extreme programming, rapid appliation dev., rational unify process
- scrum
  - basic structure : sprint (1-4 weeks)
  - working product after each sprint
  - cross-functional teams of 5-10 people
  - meet daily
    ![](img/305-20.jpg)
  - product owner : represents customer interests, maximizes buisness value
  - team : build the product, multiple domain, self-managing
  - scrum master : ensure team success (not manager) protect team from outside interference, helps resolve impediments
  - manager : not a nanny but a guru
  - product backlog : to-do list to prioritized by value to customer (contaisn features, dev. requirements, bugs, reserach) evolves over time, team provides estimates
  - sprint planning meeting : review of product backlog, team selects items to complete, go for the sprint
  - daily scrum : what was done (rapidly), no discussion, just rapporting, and what will be done until next scrum
  - if goal not met, learn from it
  - sprint review : demo product, everyone, ask questions, last as long as needed
  - sprint retrospective : updates product backlog, can be done by someone from outside, maintain the pace

## Information security
- confidentiality : not disclosed to unauthorized parties
- integrity : data modifications must be detected
- availability : information available when needed
- authenticity : each party is who they claim to be
- accountability : actions of a party can be traced uniquely to that party
- security controls
  - administrative : policies, procedures (enforce logical and phyical)
  - logical : encryption, access control
  - physical : locks, separation of duties
- challenges
  - threat : deliberate (cracker), accidental (failure), environmental (tornado)
  - vulnerability : buffer underflow
  - attack : assault, intelligent act to violate the security
  - anticipate abnormal behavior
- attacks
  - interruption : availability (disrupting traffic)
  - interception : confidentiality (eavesdropping)
  - modification : integrity (corrupting)
  - fabrication : authenticity, accountability (forging data)
  - toolkit : disassemblers, debuggers, fuzzers, malware
- risks
  - connectivity : globally accessible
  - extensibility : plugin architectures
  - complexcity : system sizes
- security is not a feature but a property
  - lack of planning issue
  - cannot be added
- pillars of soft. security
  - risk management : understand and quantify
  - soft. dev. for security : best practices
  - knowledge : prescriptive (principles), diagnostic (exploits), historical
    ![](img/305-21.jpg)
- buisness goals
  - high ROI (return on investments)
  - high SLA (service level agreement)
  - reducing dev. costs
  - rank goals according to priority
  - identify risks and threats : into context (likelihood, severity, impact, frequency, completeness)
- monitor and update risks over time
  - validation process : penetration tests, security tests
  - measure progress
    ![](img/305-22.jpg)
- known problems
  - target priviledged level : root
  - argument injection : shell scripts
  - embedding scripts in scripts : mix languages
  - buffer overflows 
    ![](img/305-23.jpg)
  - attack configuration files
  - manipulate parsing
  - abusing input sanitization : cross-site scripting, use local filename
  - client-server : directly to the server, manipulate session ID, inject scripts into variables
  - race conditions
  - misuse of cryptograhpy
  - password management : unsalted hashes
- best pratices
  - check code quality : broken error handling
  - encapsulation : restrict interactions
  - defensive programming : separate clean inside from dirty outside
  - white list, not black list
  - decouple user input from application logic
  - least privilege
  - redundant security controls
  - multiple layers : firewall, vpn, authentication, checksums, bometric access

## Refactoring
- improve code : prevent decay, clean up, simplify, increase readability
- avoid future problems : find bugs, reduce debugging time
- rethink, be creative : better way to solve a problem
- code smell : indication for refactoring, bad practices
  ![](img/305-27.jpg)
  - feature envy : using more from another class (move or extract)
  - shotgun surgery : making a change require many changes (move or extract)
- workflow : save original, simplify and tests for correctness (chance of error is high for a few line), review changes
- risks
  - introduce new bugs
  - expensive
  - easy to waste time (focus on the 20%)
  - refactor when : changes needed, add method of class, fix bug, smells
  - do not refactor when : close to deadline, API published, behind a clean interface, someone else is working with the code
- composing fields, methods and classes
  - extract method : improves clarity
  - inline method
  - remplace temporary var by a method
  - subsitude algorithm
  - class with too much functionnality : divide
- duplicated code
  - in same class or method : extract
  - in sibiling classes : extract and pull up
  - in different classes : extract
  - different algorhtm : subsitute algorithm and extract
- inheritance
  - pull up fields
  - share same features : creates superclass
  - replace inheritance with delegration

## Performance and optimization
- latency : time from submission to receipt of first bit (threshold ~200ms latency)
  - throughput: # of ops per second
- 80/20 rule : 20% of code use 80% of runtime
- focus on observable performance : end user matterns
- improve performance receipt
  - turn on compiler optimizations
  - try another compiler
  - adapt performance requirements
  - get faster hardware
  - change high-level design
  - tune the code : only if really needed
- process
  - write functionnaly complete software including tests
  - save known-good version
  - profile code to find bottlenecks
- premature optimization is the root of all evil (Donald Knuth)
- measurements
  - profilers : instrumentation, dump, interpret
  - sampling-based profilers : minimize interference
  - duration : wall-clock time, CPU ticks, app ticks vs kernel ticks, synchronization time
  - page faults
  - cache misses
  - branch mispredictions
- best pratices
  - make common case fast
  - keep infrequent case correct
- low performance sources
  - unnecessary IO
  - cache miscomprehension : matrix multiplication
  - control flow
    - if : fastest test first and most likely to be true
    - prefer switch statements
    - loop early exit
    - loop unswitching : if inside loop
    - loop jamming : join similar loop
    - loop unrolling
    - place busiest loop inside : swap loop reduce condition checks
    - replace operation with cheaper ones
  - data accesses
    - caching lacks
    - memoization
    - precomputing results : constants

# Automated testing
![](img/305-24.jpg)
![](img/305-25.jpg)
- automation
  - blackbox testing : determine equivalence classes of inputs (fast, easy, manual configuration, redundance)
  - input generation : derived from specifications, probabilistics, corner cases, grammers
  - whitebox testing : determine equivalence classes of program paths (SMT solvers)
  - contracts : precondition and postcondition
- static code analysis : slow, hard to scale
  - analyze without execution
  - look for generic bugs : injection, NPE
  - look for functional errors : contract violations
  - findbugs
    - difficult language features
    - misunderstood API, invariants
    - code modified during maintenance
    - typos, bad operators
    - hard part : dealing with reports
      ![](img/305-26.jpg)
- manage issues over time : prioritize, use filter, highlight new issues wiht bug trackers
