- theories : possible theories

  - coding
    - motor cortex : high-level parameters (direction, magnitude of hand velocity)
    - motor cortex : low-level parameters (muscle force, mechanical power)
    - cortical neurons : force level generated by groups of muscles
    - direction of arm coded by neurons with varying fring rates as cosine function of angle between cell preferred direction and movement direction
  - planning
    - CNS plans multijoint arm movements using coordinates of joint angles and hand position, robust against inherent errors in motor system
    - cost function associated with production of movement trajectory
    - based local geometric features (two-third power law)
    - CNS selects particular movement primitives and rules so motor system resolve excess degree of freedom problem, defining number of solutions
    - major objective of motor coordination is achieving smoothest possible movement under circumstances
  - control
    - basic component of primate grasping : hand transport and preshaping
    - taken separately using two coordinated control mechanisms
    - taken as single limb using single control mechanisms
    - more plausible : coordinated smaller and simpler controllers
  - execution
    - hand velocity profiles : start and end characterized by bell shape
    - two-thirds power law : natural drawing consist of decreasing angular velocity with increasing curvature, $A=KC^{2/3}$ with $A$ angular velocity, $C$ movement curvature, $K$ constant

- models

  - internal model : neural mechanisms that mimics input-output relationships of limbs and external objects

    - forward internal : predict sensory consequences of given motor command, provide mechanism to vercome delay involved in sensing actual outcome, mental simulation, CNS use this for grip force modulation
    - inverse internal : starts from desired sensory state and outputs accordingly
    - grip force-load force coupling : observed when hand moved voluntarily while object held by finger opposing thumb, sensory delay in relaying change in load force to CNS 50-100ms

  - controls

    - FARS : neural ingredients of reach and grasp in terms of functional schemas, convert information to grasp affordances that are selected given task constraints, execution unfolds with a sequencing mechanism that monitor phases (maximum aperture reached, object contact) implemented by basal ganglia and presupplementary motor area F6 via inhibition and disinhibition![2E043887-FD76-47AF-B402-5027A0A57527](img/2E043887-FD76-47AF-B402-5027A0A57527.png)

    - Hoff-Arbib : coordination of timing transport and preshape, time-to-completion signal, explain temporal relation of hand kinematics with finger aperture kinematics, modular decomposition of transport, preshape and enclose controllers, accounts for smooth correction in response to position or object size alteration, temporal invariance, schema that needs longer time slows the other down![70B87DBA-412E-403C-80D1-A87616DABDF4](img/70B87DBA-412E-403C-80D1-A87616DABDF4.png)

    - Kawato : explain grip force-load force coupling, how CNS adjust grip force according to predicted using forward and inverse models, how CNS guarantees stability, 3 key computational elements arm controller, grip controller and forward model, good for single object

      ![CF974798-4BC8-420B-BB04-21E18AFCB153](img/CF974798-4BC8-420B-BB04-21E18AFCB153.png)

      - mosaic model : multiple objects, modular adaptive controller learn multiple dynamics with different properties, can implement Karato model


  - grasp learning : require two forces applied to object

    - pad opposition : between set of fingers, holding a peanut
    - palm opposition : between fingers and palm, holding a hammer
    - side opposition : between thumber volar surface and radial finger sides, holding a key
    - transform high degree of freedom into lower dimensional problem : which opposition for given object

- motor primitives

  - muscle synergies : reduce number muscle controlled, in principle orthogonal to each others, complex movements require as many syngergies as muscles
    - extraction : with activation coefficient
    - factorization : PCA, FA, ICA, NNMF
    - reconstruction
  - kinematic energy (recovery)

- study motor control : animal models, neuroimaging, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), motion analysis, electrophysiological signal

  - muscle synergie : reduce complexity of motor control, extraction $D(t)=\sum_{i=1}^M c_i(t)w_i$ with $w$ synergies, $C$ coefficients, 5 synergies enough to explain upper limb variance
    - neuro-rehabilitation : modifies synergies

- redundancy : movement coordination master redundant degrees of freedom

  - manipulation motor control force production : individual fingers don't exert maximal force when working together (tendons originated from same muscle, a central neural drive (CND) has a max)

  - manipulation motor control posture : PCA for coarser level, finer level distributed among all joint angles

  - upper limb synergies : modification induced by disorders

##  Modifications in motor control of reaching and grasping due to neuropathologies

- prognosis : predicting likelihood of a person's survival/future
- stroke : interruption of blood supply to the brain, damage brain tissue
  - symptoms : sudden weakness unresponsiveness of the face, arm or leg, mostly on one side
    - spasticity : velocity dependent increase in tone, upper motor neuron dysfunction, abnormal regulation of strech reflex
    - apraxia : inability to perform learned task, motor planning areas MCA territory in dominant hemisphere
  - effect : post stroke
    - reach-to-grasp : variability, slower hand transport and aperture, inaccurate scaling of peak grasp, spatio-temporal coordindation decoupling, issue with extensor muscle activation, grip force less cordindates
    - upper limb : abnormal muscle coactivation as function of force direction and magnitude, reduced spatial and temporal efficiency, control using more feedback-guided with greater demand for error correction
    - rehabilitation : training towards patient specifc motor deficit, no learning deficit per se but slowness to develop required force to anticip control
    - quantitative motor control : differentiation between compensation and true recovery
  - recovery
    - (sub-)acute phase : first 6 months, try to recover healthy condition, use muscle synergies
    - chronic phase : after, compensatory movements, not able to learn back
- parkinson : progressive decline in motor function, proprioceptive deficits
  - symptomes : tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural problems, loss of kinaesthetic sensitivity (conscious perception of limb and body motion) result in lack of precision and dexterity
    - dyskinesia : hypersensibility, might be improved by injecting L-Dopa 
  - effect : dependent on external stimuli to initiate and shape motor output
    - reaching and grasping : distal body segments more affected, decreaserd movement speed, shorten amplitude, increased use of visual feedback, limited hand rotation, smaller peak aperture
      - reaching : always complete te movements, minimal rotatory, very little trunk movements (before limb, before reaching initiation, opposite direction of reaching)

## Electrical stimulation for the restoration of grasping

- standard therapy : routine in hospital everyday
- electrical stimulation (ES) : short series of electrical current pulses between pairs of electodes, activate motor neurons
  - types : transcutaneous, percutaneous - though the skin, epimysial - implanted onto muscle surface, around nerve
  - pulses : monophasic or charge-balanced biphasic (symmertic or asymmetric - providing optimal control of contraction force whilst minimizing tissue damage)
  - fatigue : can reduce fatigue, not sure
- orthotics : modify structural or functional characteristices of muscles
- prostheses : grasp
  - HandMaster : array of 5 electrodes, control unit sends bi-phasic pulses, initiatve patterns
