# EPFL

This repository contains summaries and cheatsheets of a 5 year-long curriculum at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch). It is mostly focused on computer science, communication systems, data science and computational neuroscience. This includes both undergraduate and graduate courses, sometimes in french, sometimes in english.

The goal is to provide a clear, concise, consistent and structured overview of each courses. As their contents evolve over the years, some parts might be outdated, missing or need some rework to fit everyone's expectations. These summaries and cheatsheets are complement to original courses supports and might not be comprehensible without.
