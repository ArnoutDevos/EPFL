  - **queuing delay** $(packetsize=bits)\frac{arrival}{R=bits/s}$ (diff. average and min. delay) : time it takes to a packet in the buffer to be processed
    - average queing delay / variance of queuing delay
    - depends on traffic pattern (arrival rate, burst, transmission outgoing link)
    - queuing delay upper bound : $N\frac{L}{R}$ where $N$ packets, $L=bits$ packet size, $R=bits/s$ transmission rate
  - **processing delay** : time it takes to process a packet

    - **malware** : infect end-system (virus requires user interaction, worm does not)
    - **botnet** : army of compromised end-systems

## The Application Layer
- design an application
  - **architecture** : which process does what
  - **communication protocol** : what sequence of messages can be exhanged
  - **transport service** : what delivery guarantees are needed
- architecture
  - process : request, answer, always running, reachable at a fixed know process address
  - process address : 128.156.72.16 (IP), 80 (port)
  - **client-server** : client request server answer
    - clear separation of roles
    - dedicated infrastructure for server (one machine, datacenter)
  - **peer-to-peer** : client are server and vice versa
    - both roles
    - peer : personnally own-system
- communication protocol (for example HTTP)
- transport service
  - reliable message delivery (TCP) : complete or signals failure
  - guaranteed performance (not provided by transport-layer) : mimimum throughput (voice) or maximum end-to-end packet delay (voice)
  - guaranteed security (half-layer : SSL) : confidentiality, data integrity, authenticity
  - TCP : reliable, stateful (maintain state of communication)
  - UDP : no expectation, stateless
- **web**
  - architecture : client-server
  - communication protocol : HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to answer OK, Not Found, Moved permanently, Bad request)
  - transport service : TCP
    - persistent : less delay (client), fewer resources (server)
    - non-persistent (old) : create new TCP connection per HTTP request (GET->Connection: close)
    - one/multiple connections : parallel TCP connections
    - RTT : round-trip time
  - cookie : state kept by the server and links subsequent HTTP requests
  - web/proxy caching : copies of other web-server files, time expiration management (GET->If-modified-since: Fri, 3 OCt 2014 10:00:00)
  - url : address for web object (hostname + file name) translated to IP
- **FTP**
  - transport service : TCP 21
  - new TCP connection at each transfer
- **SMTP**
  - transport service : TCP 25
  - sender connect to receiver mail server
  - message must be 7-bit ASCI
  - POP3 (stateless) download and delete vs download and keep
  - IMAP (stateful) everything in one place (server)
- **DNS** (Domain Name Service)
  - single DNS server does not scale -> does not work well with many users (failure, too much traffic, cannot be close, maintenance)
  - hierarchy : root servers, TLD (top-level domain) servers (.com, .ch), authoriative servers (epfl.ch, amazon.com)
  - request (recursive or iterative) : local DNS server -> root DNS server -> .ch TLD DNS server -> epfl.ch servers (each level talks only to one level down)
  - caching DNS answer at all levels to reduce delay
  - DNS queries and replies, Resource Records (RR : name, value, type, Time-To-Live)
  - different queries : A (hostname, IP), NS (domain, authoritative DNS hostname), CNAME (canonical hostname), MX (mail)
  - UDP port 53
  - attack : impersonate and send fake answer or DOS root server or poison the cache of a DNS server (multiple request on low access domains)
- **BitTorrent**
  - client-server : linear $D_{CS}\ge max(\frac{NF}{u_s}, \frac{F}{d_{min}})$ where $N$ number of downloaders, $u_s$ server upload capacity, $d_{min}$ peer donwload capacity
  - p2p : sub-linearly $D_{P2P}\ge max(\frac{F}{u_s}, \frac{F}{d_{min}}, \frac{NF}{u_s+\sum u_i})$
  - sources of the metadata, IDs of peers : tracker (server, one node that keeps track of which peers have the given content) or set of peers (distributed hash table DHT : content key -> end-system identifiers, keeps track of which peers have what content)
  - sources of data : peers
  - scale
  - torrent : group of peers exchanging
  - tit-for-tat : selecting randomly new peer, send chunks to those currently sending its chunk at highest rate
  - unchoked : best four peers
  - rarest first

## The Transport Layer and Socket Programming
- **socket** : interface between application and transport layer
- **transport layer** (communication between processes) vs **network layer** (communication between hosts)
- **UDP** (connectionless, unreliable, unordered delivery) vs **TCP** (connection-oriented, flow and congestion control)
- no delay and bandwidth guarantees
- **multiplexing** (at sender) : handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- **dexmultiplexing** (at receiver) : use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket
  - IP-layer datagram : source IP, destination IP
  - segments format (TCP/UDP) : source port # | dest port # | other header fields | data
  - TCP socket identified : (source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port)
  - UDP socket identified : (IP adress, port)
- server waits for connections on welcoming socket and creates new "communication socket"
- UDP socket : unreliable, datagram, no handshake, sender explicitly attaches the address to each packet
- TCP socket : reliable, byte-stream oriented, handshake, welcoming socket

## The Transport Layer
- **reliable data delivery** (RDT) : no lost data, no duplicate data
- await data <-> await (N)ACK : send => make packet and send <-> receive and is NACK => send <-> receive and is ACK => -
- await packet <-> corruption check : receive and is corrupt => send NACK <-> receive and is not corrupt => send ACK, extract and deliver
- **checksum** : redundant information to check integrity and/or correct corruption
- NACK : not acknowledge
- **ACK** : acknowledge, feedback from receiver to sender to overcome data corruption
- if no (N)ACK received then it is reemitted (timeout)
- **sequence numbers** : identifier for segments included in each ACK, used to disambiguate between segments
- **timeout** : an expected ACK is late, used to overcome data loss
- RDT : checksum + ACK + retransmissions + timeouts
- **sliding-window request** (pipelining) : multiple requests authorized better than stop/wait
- **go-back-N** : receiver accepts 0 out-of-order segments, ACK are cumulative (all segment lower than # have been received) when retransmitting all the un-ACK-ed segments
- **selective repeat** : receiver accepts $N-1$ out-of-order packets, ACK are selective (segment # only has been received), retransmitting only one segments when timeout
- **busy-time** : $\frac{N\cdot sendtime}{RTT+sendtime}$
- **TCP** : set of resources allocated at end-systems (sockets, buffers, variables)
  - **3-way handshake**
  - reliability
    - **sequence number** (by sender, # of first byte of data)
    - **ACK number** (by receiver, # of oldest byte expected)
    - **timeout** ($estimatedRTT+4devRTT$ with $estimatedRTT=0.875estimatedRTT+0.125sampleRTT$ and $devRTT=variance(RTT)$) : retransmit the segment with oldest un-ACKed sequence number
    - **fast retransmit** : if 3 duplicate ACKs received
  - **flow control**
    - receiver window (provided by receiver) : free space in TCP buffer
  - end with FIN/FINACK,ACK (3-way)
  - security
    - impersonate : randomized sequence number
    - syn flooding : no syn buffer but use non-forgettable tickets
  - congestion control
    - bad congestion effects (long queuing delays, resource waste)
    - at network layer : packet switches send congestion signals to end-hosts
    - at transport layer : end-hosts signal congestion to each other
    - **maximum send window** : $R\; bps \cdot RTT\; s = b$ (bandwidth-delay product)
    - ACK = no congestion (increase window size) vs no ACK = congestion (reduce window size)
    - **exponentially (slow start)** by 1 MSS (maximum segment size) for every ACK
    - **linearly (congestion avoidance)** by 1 MSS every RTT (when congestion expected)
    - start with exponential increase : if timeout, reset window to MSS and set congestion threshold to last window size divided by 2
    - transistion to linear increase when window reaches congestion threshold

# The Network Layer
- **forwarding** : header values correspond to output link (inside router)
- **routing** : network wide process that determines end-to-end path
  - centralized vs distributed routing algorithm
- connection setup : connection state in routers
  - virtual circuit on demand (forwarding state, per connection)
- possible network-layer services
  - guaranteed (in-order) delivery
  - guaranteed maximum delay
  - guranteed minimum throughput
  - security (confidentiality, authenticity)
- datagram network (forwarding state) : scales better and simpler
- **IP prefix** : range of IP adresses formatted by a mask
- **IP subnet** : network area without any router included, all end-systems and router have the same IP prefix
- IP are obtain from ISP or regulatory body
- IP are distributed by network operator to router (manually) and to end-systems (mostly DHCP)
- **private address space** : subnet with one single entry using a NAT (network address translation, requires per connection)
- **IP fragmentation** : router can fragment packets
- least-cost path routing
  - **link-state routing** algorithm : centralized either on router or on a separate machine (Dijkstra)
  - **distance-vector routing** algorithm : distributed, exchange of local link cost and neighbor messages
    - **poisoned reverse** if a connection is lost
- internet routing challenges
  - scale : flooding, no convergeance
  - administrative autonomy : manipulate routing
- **autonomous systems** : different administration with possible differences inside (routing)
  - **intra-AS routing** (RIP, OSPF) : run by all router inside the same AS
  - **inter-AS** (BGP border gateway protocol) : router distributes reachability information to external router through e-BGP, router distributes external reachability information to other local routers through i-BGP
  - **BGP** selects route that crosses fewer AS, fewer local routers, higthest local preference
- security
  - **encryption symetric** (RC4, AES, Blowfish)
  - **encryption asymetric** public + vs private - key (RSA, DSA)
  - **hashes**
  - confidentiality
     message authentication code MAC : hash key with a message
  - **authenticity** : asymetric encryption of nonce and message hash
    - digital signature : private encrypt hash (can check correctness with public key)
    - **nonce** : random string shared (avoid replay attacks)
    - need a trusted certificate authority (CA)
  - integrity
    - control hashes
  - email : asymetric encryption on symetric key
  - SSL (3-handshake way) : sever send public key, client send back a shared master key, and then create 4 session keys (a encrypting key and a MAC for each part) included sequence number

# The Link Layer
- transfer data (frame) from one node (routers, switches, hosts) to a physically adjacent node : ethernet, frame relay, WiFi
- link layer services
  - **error dection** : detect bit errors, drop frames with errors
    - single bit parity (single error)
    - two dimensional bit parity (correct single bit errors)
    - cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
  - reliable data delivery : error correction/retransmission
  - **link access** : share same link with other nodes
  - pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes
- software and hardware implemented
- types of links
  - point-to-point (ethernet)
  - broadcast (wifi)
- **multiple access protocols**
  - collision and interference could occur
  - channel partitioning (inefficient at low load) : time slots, frequency bands
  - random access (inefficient at high load) : no division, try to detected and recover from collisions
  - taking turns (best of best world) : nodes are invited to transmit by master
  - CSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access : sense before transmitting, defer if busy
- **Carrier Sense Multiple Access** (CSMA)
  - senses, wait until idle for sending
  - transmits entire frame without detecting another transmission
  - if detects another, abort and sends jam signal then enter exponential backoff
- **Eternet* *** bus (shared collision domain) vs star (unique for each ends)
- **MAC addresses** : 48 bit used to move frames between link-layer nodes
- **ARP** address resolution protocol : broadcasts request for MAC address
- **switch** : similar to router forwarding but self-learned table and based on MAC address (if no entry, flood)
- **switch vs router** : network layer (3) vs link layer (2), store-and-forward, self-learning vs routing

  - DHCP to get : IP address, subnet mask, IP first-hop router, IP dns server
  - DHCP discovery message encapsulated in UDP, IP, Ethernet
  - Ethnernet broadcast on LAN (MAC 0xF)
