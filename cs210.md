Fall 2014: Functional Programming

[TOC]

## Functions & Evaluations
- imperative programming : modifying mutable variable, assignments, loops, too close to word by word (Von. Neumann)
- oriented-object programming : orthogonal to other paradigm
- functional programming : theory, data types, operations, laws between values and operation, no mutations
- non-primitive expression
  1. take leftmost operator
  2. evaluate its operands
  3. apply the operator to the operands
- primitive types : as in Java but capitalized
- call-by-value : `def power(x: Double, y: Int): Double = ...`
   1. evaluate all args (left to right)
   2. replace function application by the function
   3. replace formal parameters by actual args
- call-by-name : `def power(x: => Double, y: => Int): Double = ...`
  1. apply the function to unreduced args
- substitution model : reduce an expression to a value (no side effect) called $\lambda$-calculus
- if call-by-value terminates, then call-by-name terminates too
- def : by-name
- value : by-value
- return value : last element of block

## Higher Order Functions
- rewriting rule : $[v_1/x_1,\ldots,v_n/x_n]B$ means expression $B$ in which all occurences of $x_i$ have been replaced by $v_i$
- tail recursion : if a function calls itself as its last action, stack can be reused, it is tail recursive (iterative), `@tailrec`
- anonymous function : `(x: Int) => x*x` is the short way (syntactic sugar) of defining `def f(x: Int)=x*x;f`
- high-order functions : take a function as or/and return a function
- currying : `def f(arg1)...(argN)=E` equivalent to `def f = (arg1 => ... (argN => E))`
  - `def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int = ...` has type `(Int => Int) => (Int, Int) => Int`
  - functional type associate to the right

## Data & Abstraction
- `override` to force redefinition
- private member inside classes `class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) { priate def... }`
- self reference : `this`
- precondition : `class ... { require(y > 0, "blabl") }` throws an `IllegalArgumentException`
- assert : like precondition but emits a `AsssertionError`
- primary constructor : takes parameters of the class and executes all statements in the class body
- auxiliary constructors : `def this(x: Int) = this(x, 1)`
- infix notation : any method with a parameter can be used like an infix operator
- relaxed identifiers : alphanumeric, symbolic, underscore (`x1 * +?%& vector_++`)
- precedence rules : letters, |, ^, &, < >, = !, :, + -, * / %, others
- `def unary_op` is called when `op(object)`
- method terminating with a colon associate to the right (not left)
- abstract classes can contain members which are missing an implemenentation
- if no superclass, standard class Object in Java is assumed
- direct and indirect superclasses of a class are called base classes
- object : single-object class called singleton, this is a value
- programs : `object Hello { defmain(agrs: Array[String]) = println("hw") }`
- dynamic binding like in Java
- package and import : `import week3.{Rational, Hello}` or `import week3._` (wildcard)
- traits : like interface but with concrete methods but cannot have value parameters
- types
  - Any : base type of all types (==, !=, equals, hashCode, toString)
  - AnyRef : base type of all reference types (java Object)
  - AnyVal : base type of all primitive types
  - Nothing : subtype of every other type
- exceptions : similar to Java's
- can be set to null if it is a subclass of Object (type is then Null)

## Types & Pattern Matching
- value parameters abreviation : `class Ex(val head: Int)`
- type parameters : `class Cons[T](val head: T)` and `singleton[T](elem: T)` direclty inferred in most of the case
- function are treated as objects in Scala : a function A => B is an abbreviation for scala.Function1[A,B] which is `trait Function[A,B] { def apply(x: A): B }`
- types bounds : `def f[S <: T](r: S)` where `<:` means S subtype of T and `>:` means supertype of T (even mix both one after the other)
- Liskov Substitution Principle : if A <: B, then everything one can to do with a value of type B one should also be able to do with a value of type A
- variance : mutable is not covariant and are if some conditons are met, if A <: B
  - C[A] <: C[B] covariance C[+A]
  - C[A] >: C[B] contravariant C[-A]
  - C[A] nothing C[B] nonvariant C[A]
  - in general : function contravariant in args and covariant in result `trait Function1[-T,+U] { def apply(x: T): U }`
  - covariant type may appear in lower bound
  - contrevariant type may appear in upper bound
- case classes : define companion objects with apply methods
- pattern match : `e match { case Number(n) => n; case Sum(e1, e2) => ... }`
- forms of pattern : contructors, variable (always lowercase), wildcard (_), constants

## Lists
- immutable, recursive, homogeneous type
- empty list object Nil
- constrution operation :: : `1 :: 2 :: Nil` same as `Nil.::(2).::(1)`
- list operations
  - head : first element
  - tail : list composed of all elements except first
  - isEmpty
  - length
  - last
  - init : list consisting of all elements exception the last one
  - take n : n first element of the list
  - drop n : rest of list after having taken n
  - (n) : element n
  - ++ ys : add a list to another
  - reverse
  - updated(n, x)
  - indexOf x
  - contains x
  - splitAt n
- pattern match : Nil, p :: ps, List(p1,...,pN)
- tuple : `val tuple = (e1,...eN)`, access to element `tuple._i`, can be pattern matched
- implicit parameters : avoid passing some type argument `msort(implicit ord: Ordering)`
- high-order list operations
  - map f
  - filter f
  - filterNot f
  - partition f : (filter f, filterNot f)
  - takeWhile f
  - dropWhile f
  - span f : (takeWhile f, dropWhile p)
- wildcard function : `((x, y) => x*y)` is equivalent to `(_*_)`
- list reduction operation
  - reduceLeft op : ((x1 op x2) op ...) op xN
  - foldLeft z op : ((z op x1) op ...) op xN
  - foldRight z op : x1 op (... (xN op z))
- structural induction : to prove a property P(xs) for all lists xs, show P(Nil) holds (base case), for a list xs and some element x show if P(xs) holds then P(x :: xs) also holds (induction step)

## Collections
- vector : better balanced than List
  - +: : add new element in front
  - :+ : add new element at end
- base class of List and Vec are Seq and Iterable
- Arrays and Strings support same operations as Seq but come from Java so no subclass
- Range : evenly spaced integers
  - x until y
  - x to y
  - r by s
- more on Seq :
  - exists p
  - forall p
  - zip ys : pairs down elements
  - unzip
  - flatMap f
  - sum
  - product
  - max
  - min
- pattern match on map : `x.map(xy => xy._1*xy._2)` is equivalent to `x.map{ case (x,y) => x*y }`
- for-expression : `p filter (i => i > 20) map (i => i.name)` is equivalent to `for ( i <- p if i > 20) yield i.name
- for translation
  1. `for (x <- e1) yield e2` is `e1.map(x => e2)`
  2. `for (x <- e1 if f; s) yield e2` is `for (x <- e1.withFilter(x => f); s) yield e2`
  3. `for (x <- e1; y <- e2; s) yield e3` is `e1.flatMap(x => for (y <- e2; s) yield e3)`
- Set : unordered, no duplicates, contains is the fundamental operation- for queries
- Map
  - constructor `Map("i" -> 1, "j" -> 2)`
  - tuple iterable
  - are function type key => value : `capitalOfCountry("US")` gives NoSuchElementException is not found
  - result of get is Option value : Some(x) and None
  - default values : withDefaultValue turns map into a total function
- repeated parameter : `Polynom(bindings: (Int, Double)*)` get all parameters
- queries
  - sortWith p
  - sorted
  - groupBy e

## Lazy Evaluation
- streams : like List but tail elements is computed on demand
  - \#:: to replace ::
- by-name evaluation : everything in recomputed
- strict evalutation : normal parameters and val definition (default evaluation)
- lazy evaluation : delay until asked `lazy val x = expr`
- infinite streams : `def from(n: Int): Stream[Int] = n #:: from(n+1)`
