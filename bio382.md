## Robotics and synergies

- traditional therapy
  - physical therapist assists patient during execution of motor task
  - promotes relearning of motor tasks and recovery capabilities
  - limits : few hours per week, patient forced to go to hosptial, functional assessment is qualitative
- robot : mechanical or virtual artificial agent guided by computer program
- assisted-as-needed approach
  ![](./img/bio382-53.jpg)
- robot-based neurorehabilitation : as effective as traditional intensive care
  - desired properties : robot should remain invisible, human-friendly, safe, small, lightwright, quiet, compliant, therapist keep the patient confidence
  - gain : more intense and involving, minimal supervision, exercises can be diversified with level of difficulty, sensory feedback, objective parameters
  - advantages : long periods of time, consistent, precise, measure, track progress, could be mass-produced for home
  - telerehabilitation : connected and supervised through internet
  - end-effector interface : synergies, mimic behavior of natural effector (hand) 
- types
  - class I systems : more sophisticated mechanical and control structure, high cost
  - class II systems : simple mechanical structure, no backdrivability (only the motor can move it), active compensation of inertia/friction required, low cost
- MEMOS : class II, movements between $P1$ and $P2$, controller checks whether voluntary movement, if no starts to complete passively the move, $s(t)=k_pF_p(t)+V_Rt\delta(F_{MIN},T_D)$
  - force estimation : $F_p$
  - stiffness : $k_p$

- tailored robotic therapy : generally, therapist selects exercice, difficulty, duration, not many attempt to make it quantitative (e.g. kinematics performances, EMG activity, psychophysiological measurements based)
- personalized robot-based neurorehabilitation : statistical model of learning, selection of protocol
- abnormalities caused by different muscular activation patterns : could result alterated behavioural and kinematics outcomes, motor performance alone cannot offer a representation of the patient state 
- robot choice of trajectories/speed impact brain organization : still poor choices, during passive moves robot should follow natural one to avoid unnatural sensory feedback- non invasive study
  - cortical signals during moves : EEG microstates
    - meta-stables states characterized by period of coherent synchronized activation of neural network (duration of 8-120ms)
    - alteration asociated with mood disorders
    - visualization of global brain activity during moves
    - building blocks of information processing in resting state
    - experimental protocol : HM trajectories differ from LT and MJ and speed profile in LT differs from one in MJ and HM
    - conclusion
      - EEG microstate does not seem to be influced by choice of trajectory, speed and acceleration in healthy individuals
      - choice of trajectory and speed should be carefully considered in design of passive robot-mediated rehabilitative training
